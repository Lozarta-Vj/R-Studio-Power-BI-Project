# Hollywood Film Performance: 2007-2011

The aim of this project was to analyse the performance of Hollywood films on their commercial success and audience ratings. I used **R Studio for data cleaning and preparation**, and **Power BI for creating an interactive visualisation**, showing key performance indicators.

**Key insights include**:

* Disney consistently ranking highly in both profitability and audience ratings
* Animation genre ranking highest in both ratings and worldwide gross
  
This dashboard was originally created during my data analysis training. After a year of further learning and practice, I improved it by focusing on clarity and user experience.
